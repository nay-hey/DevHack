DASHBOARD GENERATOR
The project will involve the development of a web-based dashboard generator that allows users to upload datasets and easily create visually appealing dashboards. The dashboard will support features such as customizable charts, graphs, and tables. Additionally, the website will integrate AI/ML algorithms to automatically analyze the uploaded data, identify patterns, and provide answers to specific queries posed by the user.
